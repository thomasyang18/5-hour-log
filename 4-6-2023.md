## Problem Review

Solo practices suck. Also USACO Plat solo practices really suck.

P1 was just "see suffix tree problem", but I completely forgot how the code really worked. It took like 40 minutes to get back to a point where I understood it, and I even gave up after the TLE. However, I just needed a few more pushes - the suffix tree algorithm wasn't broken, I'm just stupid and forgot that the entire point of a compressed suffix tree is to NOT iterate through every element in the string... I solved it 10 minutes after I gave up :/

I also forgot to remove pragmas during P1, which is something we're doing at NAC as well.

I suppose this is a lesson in, if I know how to do the problem but I don't know how to implement it, probably move on.

P2, I saw the editorial idea immidiately but I had no idea how to implement it. I probably could have gotten it if I thought harder about it, it wasn't that bad.

P3 was kind of insane, but I should start getting used to these types of observations. In fact, I thought about bsearch at one point, but on the answer, not per cow, which is smart.

## Time Spent Review

P1 is definitely a risky problem at NAC, but it's so appealing - the actual algorithm isn't difficult at all (once you have a suffix tree template), but remembering how all the intracacies of how that template works on site is annoying. All I can say is, I'm thankful that this happened in a practice and not at NAC.

P2 and P3 were just me being lazy after dying on stupid P1 bugs/forgetting impl details for ages.

## Major Issues

I think logging and doing 2 hr practices has got me being lazier, but at the same time I'm starting to realize, I take an absurd amount of time on hard problems wasting time and goofing off. I eventually get them (usually) if it's a DP or data structure problem, but holy hell. I'm supposed to be the "bash your head against shitty impl" guy on the team, the others are good at observations and math. If I can't be good at this then wtf am I doing?

## Improvements

I hate proving things in my head before going at it, since I'm confident in my ability to wrangle out a correct solution once I have the general approach. But that only works for easy problems and problems I'm mostly familiar with, and especially when I'm upsolving something and I can submit like 14 WAs at no cost. I don't think this is a DS/impl strong suit issue, this is just a skill issue, since other people can implement complicated things fast and cleanly.
