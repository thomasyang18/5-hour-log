## Log

```
  10: Skipped problem 1, Coded up problem 2, debugging.
  20: Solved 2 with 1 WA. Got minizmiation for 1. Losing hope already
  30: Wrong idea for max on 1 after implementing.
  40: Implementing solution, debugigng with testcaases.
  50: debugging, wa again dont think my solution is even correct
  60: Writing brute forcer
  70: Brute forcer found some bugs
  80: My assumption was wrong. Moving onto problem 3
  90: Made assumption about solution based on brute forcer for 1
  100: Just brute force guessing at this point
  110: Give up
```

## Problem Review

2 was just standard bitmask DP, but I couldn't get the observation and data structure one, which is bad.

1 was figuring out the greedy (at least I'm pretty sure it was just a clever greedy), 3 was a data structure one that I didn't even really read or understand.

## Time Spent Review

I got the one problem I knew how to do beforehand really fast, so even with 1WA (which wasn't an implementation bug as much as a slight conceptual assumption that I instantly corrected), so I'm happy with that. Just be a bit more careful.

I really did not like how much time I was devoting to problem 1. The issue is, I think this is fine if I'm 100% sure I have a correct approach, but I should have realized something was wrong by minute 40, and ESPECIALLY at minute 60 onwards, where I was just guessing with the brute forcer.

## Major Issues

### Did not read/understand Problem 3

I just could not parse it or understand what it wanted, so I chose to do the greedy problem. My math is weak, so it's no surprise that I couldn't really come up with a correct greedy algorithm for this problem.

### No solid strategy/proof on Problem 1

Yeah... this was kind of just sad. Especially for greedy problems, you need to have a good proof or at least some idea of how the solution is going to go, but I handwaved that.

## Improvements

Stop random guessing with brute forcer. Also, even if a problem has an easy problem statement, the solution might be hard; remember to play to your strengths. This also does not fall under "read all problems in the first hour" mentality which is really bad.
